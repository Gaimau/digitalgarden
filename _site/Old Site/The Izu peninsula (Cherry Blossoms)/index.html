<p>So I am going to be talking about my time in the Izu Peninsula where it was so impactful for me. In general. I believe my time in the Izu Peninsula was This is so important to me is simply due to the fact that it was a first time in the stretch of practically years that my responsibilities or that the concept of my responsibilities had been boiled down and simplified. Back down into the natural state. I only cared about one thing, and that one thing was. my practice. And it's as simple as that. I didn't worry about the little... minor details of my job or a little things that upset me during the typical day, and interactions, I was simply happy to be experiencing a higher sense of peace that... was more than meditative, right? It's more than simply clearing your mind and so on and so forth, but everything, my perception of things in my.. digestion of higher models of thought, concepts and people.. were so abundantly clear that my vision had been renewed in a pure sense. The little things excited me again from seeing street signs to crosswalks. I felt unrestricted and completely free. and it was something I had not felt in such a long time. Now, to preface, I wasn't even sure I wanted to go to Japan when it was offered. However, I accepted. But in terms of actual desire and motivation to go was zero to none or next to that. And I even had thoughts about backing out of the trip because for some reason, something didn't feel right.&quot;. It felt off, I didn't feel prepared, I didn't have a plan in or itinerary . I was just gonna go to go. I had gone six years prior, and I didn't have an itinerary or a plan then. but this time felt even less organized in my own thought. So I had had doubts. However, when I got there, immediately, I was greeted by a large group of Japanese school children who are meeting people who were coming off determining all who were from different places. They had a map, and they would put a sticker for where people were coming from. And I put my little sticker down in Pennsylvania, and in my attempt at Japanese in a very broken fashion, I was able to have a great conversation with some parents and some kids about what I do, where I work. about active life I live. And it was a fruitful discussion. It was one that was. that broke the mesmerism or the concern that I didn't have anything, any purpose, anything to serve from Japan. All my interactions... are harmonious, from the sweet cafe owners to some very... culturally sound individuals. I wanted to know more about. African American culture. It was a... time where I could step back and objectively look my life. And it felt so distinct and far from me. I didn't feel like I was wrapped up in the issues of the problems.</p>
<p>Now that was my time actually in Japan about the whole. Now I talking about the Izu Peninsula.. It was probably the impactactful stop for myself. I remember we're on the train, and I'm with two of my friends and my sister. and as we moved further south on the eastern side of the main island, I remember the train ==approaching ==the coast, and we can just see this beautifully blue expanse of ocean. as far as the eye can see. And this was what started this bit of serenity, a serene recording of what the Izu Peninsula was. I... just remembered being happy for every simple little thing that I saw as we were sitting on the train, and I looked at the bottles of refreshments that we had bought from the combini sit on the windowsill. That scene sticks out in my mind because it was simply simple. Simply simple, beautiful and impactful, nonetheless, there's nothing that could have been added or taken away from that image in my mind. And it was a series, a plethora of those moments. Now, there's two places in the  Izu peninsula. I want this focus in on the first being the cherry blossoms. Now the cherry blossom Festival in the izu Peninsula. It started about three days prior. and we had managed to make it for the last day and as we. got there, we met our host and we unloaded our bags, and we were very grateful for all they had managed for us. We got a taxi with a... sweet doting Japanese man who was very willing to make conversation with us in our broken Japanese. and described a bit about what the festival I'd been in and what had taken place. And as the festival was over, it was mostly just walking amongst the cherry blossoms since that was all that was really left. And so I decided to seize the opportunity and I began to walk , walked over the bridge that had this river that was running through this small town. And as I was walking, I simply did not want to stop. I couldn't stop walking. I walked down, probably at least two to three miles of cherry blossoms, thinking, being grateful, enjoying every little breeze and petal and the beauty of it, and not in its material of form. I want to make that incredibly clear.</p>
<p>It was nothing simply about the material beauty of it, but it was the serenity and the peace that it represented with a sense of calm that it produced, that made it so incredibly impactful . I have seen many beautiful places. But the chaos of surround those places has been enough to not make a lasting impression and my mind and my heart. But there, it this seared,  stamped into my memory. And it can be.. Nothing other than the those qualities that I so associate with the time. So. after my long walk, it quickly began to go dark. And I was trying to make my way back. My friends and sister had made their way to a hot spring. And I put this up decided to keep walking because. I couldn't stop. It was incredibly compelling to continue. So I I did. And amongst that, as the sun began to fade, I had found myself at a point where there's no more cherry blossoms, the trees there were either shedding their petals or their typical plain old trees. But the beauty of the experience didn't diminish in the slightest. You know, as it was dark, I was making my way back. the little things of twilight began to pop out to me. The quaint little streets signs, and a peace and surrounded but small up town. let's chatter. soft clicks of camera shutters, taking in the last bits of the daylight that's peeking through those blossoms. What symphony.. As of right now, that's currently what are calm about those cherry blossoms and they were so impactful.</p>
