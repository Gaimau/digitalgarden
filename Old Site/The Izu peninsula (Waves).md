Now, moving on to... the waves of the E ofific. Now, the following morn, I made my way to the beach. The day prior, I had taken a quick walk before we went to the festival. to explore the beach that I had heard.  And I went there, and they saw a two amazing things. A stick or three amazing things. A stick.  The landscape and a dog photo shoot. And all of those things were exactly as they needed to be. Andered completely beauty and grandeur.  I'll start with the landscape. I walk out, and there's softwarewareructioning over the sand. That radiates this golden hue. and the piece of the waves was to simply put it lovely.  There was some crags off the coast in a small mound of rock up about the this coast line. But the beautiful pertinent blue haze and sitting in the midst of this glory radiance was the stick. A piece of drift.wood. could have been from anywhere or anything.  But there sat in the sand and undisturbed. And at the evening was coming to the close, moving into twilight. The light that fell and the shadows cast by this piece of drift wood.  It was something I wanted to capture. Again, this wood itself was nothing beautiful. But. misrepresentation was simply about the fact.  There was. It was the fact that this piece of wood was. right where it needed to be. Regardless of how it looked, or what had been through, but it was right, where it needed to be.  Somewhat similar to how I felt the moment in Japan. no matter how it guided there, no matter what I looked like. That's where it was meant to be for the time. And then... lastly, the photo shoot. also taking advantage of the day was two women with their two dogs and a photographer. and an expression of unbridled joy shared between the party of gratitude and appreciation of your friends.  There's not much to say on this point.. It was a simple reminder to. B a way?  No, quite now. Exactly. I'm still thinking about it.  Look, my group hasn't lost my memory for my thought, because. I a reason that is currently enough to. And as I write this out, it may reveal it so well.  In general, no.. You know what I up. been extremely dear to me since that time, from the E Peninsula and to man as a whole.. And I.. is what I aimed to capture. in these photos. photos like you have.
