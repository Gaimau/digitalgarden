â€œWealth isnâ€™t always measured in dollar signs. We each have time, talent, and creativity, all of which can be powerful forces for positive change. Share your blessings in whatever form they come and to whatever level you have been blessed.

- Jon M. Huntsman


Raising your voice to be heard over the open windows and 4.0 V6 engine of a 2000 Ford Ranger XLT may bring different results than your typical expectations of spring break. On this particular day, a friend and I set out to explore St. Louis. The backseats were loaded with camera gear since street photography was the objective of the day, for my friend anyway. As for myself, photography was an unfamiliar field, but an extra camera patiently awaited me amongst the rest of the equipment.

As you enter Maryland Plaza, it's identifiable by the brick-and-mortar buildings lining the street. A place where people sit at cafes on business calls, meanwhile, food service workers haul trash bags to the dumpsters in the alleyways. Attempting to catch these moments during a photo shoot, your results may range from serene to chaotic.  Not to mention when it's your first time doing proper photography, the results tend to be less than desirable. However, you will run into that one moment when you are able to muster in one concentrated effort a culmination of all you know. Take it. 

When your eyes land on that subject, and it looks important to you, take the shot.  Even if you don't know why. Raise the camera body to your cheek.  Examine it through your viewfinder. Keep yourself steady.  Finalize your focus.  Finally,  press the shutter button.

Congrats, you've done it! You've taken the photo of your dreams! Now what? That's what I asked myself for years after I had shot this photo, as it sat on various phones and laptops. I appreciated all the good it brought back to my memory and I also hoped to share it someday, but I didn't know how. Posting this photo online with a caption would not have the same significance as a cohesive narrative. Besides, let's be honest; its likely that you wouldn't frame this in your home.


Even though I love this photo, and am proud that it captured everything I wanted to encapsulate. I don't typically think about the plaza when I look at it. Rather, how we spent the Spring Break comes to mind. 

While there, we sanded and painted his parent's front door while singing Disney songs loud enough for fellow residents to hear. We helped neighbors with furniture as they were moving out. We even picked up his sister after she and her date got his car locked in a parking lot and "lectured" her all the way home about being responsible. This photo doesn't show any of that. This vacation resulted in someone becoming more hardworking, caring, and aware of the others around him. In other words , when I gave selflessly, I received this photo as a result.

That's why I made this Substack. This post is a commitment to doing more good. To more growth in grace and less selfishness. To give gratitude to the people who've helped us, to our experiences, and to good. Something that can be a **_sign_** (sorry, it was right there) of growth for more than just ourselves.

They say a pictureâ€™s worth a thousand words, but it costs so much more.

Those who say a pictureâ€™s worth a thousand words have never bought one, because it costs a vast amount more.
